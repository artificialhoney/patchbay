# SetVar

_Ops.Vars.SetVar_

This can be compared with environmental variables or global variables, sometimes it is handy to store something in the patch-scope, so all ops can access it. This is definitely _not_ the _cables_-way to do things, but sometimes itâ€™s good to reduce cable chaos.  
Can be used to store a string, number or boolean globally.

## Input

### Value

_Type: Value_  
The value you want to store globally (string, number or boolean)

### Name

_Type: Value_  
Name of the global variable you want to set
