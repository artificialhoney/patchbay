Sorts an array with the following rules:
- Get the 1st point position
- Go through the entire array and calculate the distance of every point to the 1st
- Get the index which has the smallest distance
- this index now becomes the new previous point
- remove the previous position from sorting algorithm

repeats until the entire array has been sorted.
