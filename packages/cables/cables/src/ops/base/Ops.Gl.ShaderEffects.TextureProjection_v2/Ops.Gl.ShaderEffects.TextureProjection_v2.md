This op allows you to project a texture onto an object such as a 3D mesh or MeshInstancer or Pointcloud. Should be placed after assigning a material.

When using this op to control PointSize, you can use an HDR/32bit texture to allow you to force values outside of the 0-1 range. You can also use the Amount parameter with values outside of the 0-1 range by manually entering them into the parameter panel or connecting a number op.
