Very handy op to change the center and pivot point of a shape or model.
There are 4 modes for each axis Xyz

ignore = do nothing
min = pivot from the lowest vertex of the bounding box
max = pivot from the largest vertex of the bounding box
center = pivot from the center of the bounding box

Output normally goes into the RenderGeometry op
