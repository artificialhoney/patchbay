With this op, you can write your own mathematical expression to be calculated. You can use up to 4 numbers (a, b, c, d) in this equation. Just type in the lower-case letter of the port you want to use in the equation input.

Here are a few example equations to get you started:

(a+b)*c-d
sin(a+b)-cos(c-d)
a*log(b + c * 2) / pow(b, 4)
