This is probably the most classic material of them all.

It works stand-alone or in conjunction with the light ops.

The op features 2 different diffuse color models, standard Lambert & Oren-Nayar.
Furthermore, there is a dropdown menu for 4 different specular models:
Blinn-Phong, Schlick, Phong, Gauss.

It also has Fresnel capabilities & emissive color & physical energy conservation of light (if desired).
