Increments with each trigger and loops depending on min and max loop values.
Can also work with negative numbers.
If min is greater than max then it decrements instead of incrementing

Use an op like TriggerLimiter to slow down the count through the loop.
You can also multiply the output by a very small number and use mainloop to create interesting patterns as well.
