This op is an extension for all materials. If attached after one, the material will have the capabilities to receive shadows. 
Four different shadow algorithms are selectable. 


It is also possible to use an opacity mask to discard parts of a mesh ("punch holes" into shadows).


The example on the right is a minimal example for the new Shadow op.

For intermediate examples, please refer to the shadow documentation and these patches:
