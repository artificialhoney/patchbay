This op triggers based on a given probability.

An example:

If you set the probability to 0.8, there is an 80% chance that the left output will be triggered and a 20% chance that it won't (and instead, the right output will be triggered).

If you set the probability to 0, only the right output will be triggered.
If you set the probability to 1, only the left output will be triggered.
