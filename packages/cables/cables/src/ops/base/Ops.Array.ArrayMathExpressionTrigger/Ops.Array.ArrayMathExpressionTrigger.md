Use this op to write your own mathematical functions.

Inputs can be arrays and numbers. Arrays need to be the same length, else the resulting output is `null`.

Use the inputs' lower-case letters in your expression, i.e:

`b*c+sin(a) - x`


There are 2 more variables availible for your expression: `i` and `len`

i - the current index
len - the arrays' length
