This op is designed to work with the Ops.Trigger.TriggerReceive op 
You must assign the TriggerSend op a variable name and make sure that the other TriggerReceive op has the same variable name.
This makes it possible to send triggers over large patches and into subpatches which allows for much more cleaner workflow.
