This op is able to output the note numbers and velocities of up to 3 different midi notes at once. Useful when playing chords. 

You can press "learn" and then play the notes on your midi-keyboard / in your DAW to automatically assign them to MidiChord3.

It is also possible to normalize the velocity values (which usually range from 0-127) to either "0 to 1" or "-1 to 1".
