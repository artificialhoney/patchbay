Outputs an array where only one element is `1`, the other elements are `0`. By changing the `Active Index` port you can decide which of the elements is the `1`.

E.g.:  
`Active Index` is `2`: `[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

you can also set the inactive value and active value to change the `0` and `1` to something else like `9.5` and `0.1`
