Performs a logical OR operation. If one of the input ports evaluates to `true` (not `0`), the `Result` will be `true` as well, `false` otherwise.

| Bool1 | Bool2 | Result |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 0     | 0     | 0      |
| 0     | 1     | 1      |
| 1     | 0     | 1      |
| 1     | 1     | 1      |
