This op is useful to find out if the patch is viewed from inside the cables editor UI or embedded into a website.  
This can be helpful, e.g. if you want to display debug information only when working on the patch, but not when it is shown publicly (outside the editor).


Canvas Mode is 0 for default, 1 for patch background mode (ctrl+shift+enter), 2 for fullscreen (ctrl+enter)
